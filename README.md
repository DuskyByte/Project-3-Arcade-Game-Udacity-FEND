Project 3 - Arcade Game (FEND)
===============================

To enjoy the game just download all the files and launch index.html in your favorite browser.
Once started you can play by selecting your starting character and press the spacebar, making them step forward.
The goal is to get all of the characters across to the other side.
Your characters don't like backing out so once they step forward they can not return to the safety of the bottom row.
Finally your final score will take into affect time taken to beat the game.
Try to get everyone across as quickly as possible for max score (20000).

Enjoy!!!
