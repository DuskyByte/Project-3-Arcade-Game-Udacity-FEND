Project 3 - Arcade Game (FEND)
===============================

To start playing select your starting character and press the spacebard.

The goal is to get all of the characters across to the other side.

Your characters don't like backing out so once selected they can not return to the safety of the bottom row.

Finally your final score will take into affect time taken to beat the game.

Try to get everyone across as quickly as possible for max score.

Enjoy!!!
